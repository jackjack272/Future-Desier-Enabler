	-------If you want to use this app with USA csv, on line 91 you'll need to change (row["CAD$"]) to (row["USD$"])-------

Personal information is not saved:
I would be sketched out too about feeding my csv into an random app over the internet, but there is nothing to worry about, the app just looks at 2 columbs
columb1: description, columb2: CAD$. so the credit card/ debit card is ignored fully. Secondly this is a local app so it dosent save any data, it runs, displays, and gets shut down.

HOW TO USE:
On your desktop make a new folder, name it "whatever", put in your csv- id rename it to "1" or something easy to type, and the aplication into the same folder.
open comand prompt and navigate to desktop using "cd x" x being the next file you'll navigate to on your way to the desktop. Once in the file named "whatever", type:
python final.py 1.csv month, month being a number, if the transaction are for april you'd type 4.

Licencing:
Feel free to use/modify how ever you feel appropriate, but give credit(non commercial use).Comercial use: pass $1 USD 2021 value / use.
Other wise i genuinty hope that this bring value.

Dream:
I want to build an all emcompassing application that given your month's visa transactions it'll be able to generate a budget
that allows you to maintain your lifestyle*, helps you pay off your debits, and helps you invest. My dream is to make an app
that will automate your finances so you can live your life with 1 major things less to worry about. The one thing that causes
sleep less nights, devoices and anxiety can be eliminated in with the technology of today/ future. We can build the future
we desire with the data of today. I love humanity and geunily wish to help it. I know will less financial stress bad choices,
life ultering choices and be changed. With less financial stress, people will be more pleasent & more generious.
With financial literacy buisness and buisness will thrive.

Keep in mind:
Due to in-expertise the descriptions are just the first word of the company, so a comany like "Tim Hortons"
will show up as "TIM". When using the aplication you'll need to refer back to your csv file to get the
buisnesse's whole name.

Use Case:
The use of this app is meant to be go hand in hand with a spread sheet. Lets take the needs section of your budget, you might add a
sub division in the budget for your transportation, ex: a car, the car will need gas, fluids, maintenence, insurance, what ever else.
Instead of you having to go by hand throught you'r month visa transactions hunting for: esso/ husky..,KMS tools/princess auto..,icbc/.., the tideum continues...
you open the app, feed it the csv for your month transaction then look throught the graph that's output for the companies taht intrest you.

Functionality of the app:
After feeding the app the visa's csv the program matches the month that you chose and starts to match descriptions to amounts spent.
Once finished the data is put together (how much you: owe,spent and paid) and plotted on a graph.

Graph's color choice:
On the first graph that appears the  color red was chosen to show how much in the red you are.
The second graph's choice of black was to show how much capital was stored away.
The green shows the amount of green$ is still owed.

PERSONAL FINANCE:
The younger you are the easier it is to install smart financial habbits that will last you and your grandchildren a life time.
Be mindful of the gap between where you are and where youre spending at. Spend below your means invest the diffrence. Investing 10k @7% yeild just under $70/month.
Including compounding and a bullish market youre practically midus turning $1 to $1.10 by sleeping and eating.
DONT SHORT CHANGE YOUR SELF OUT OF YOUR DREAM LIFE OVER A COFFEE A DAY!


give it your friends and family if it can help i want it to help. i dont want people loosing sleep over money when money can can be so easily managed and enslaved!
